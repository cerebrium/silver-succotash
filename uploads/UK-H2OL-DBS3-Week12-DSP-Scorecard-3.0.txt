Announcements
We are pleased to inform you that metric definitions on page 5 and 6 are now available in country specific language. This can be found in the
resources table and also in the metric definition section.

We are surfacing a reminder of the interactive metric modules available below, in the resources section. These modules cover Safety, Quality/Standard Work Compliance & Customer Feedback / Team.

We have updated the supplementary Concessions report with additional “focus areas” that identify delivery factors that may have contributed to the issuance of concessions (Incorrect Scan Indicator, Signature on Delivery , High Value Item, Delivery Exception, Mailbox Eligible). DSPs using the report experience a 35% higher reduction in DNR DPMO compared to DSPs with lower adoption rates.

Note: Users can only access the same geography modules, as example, UK can only access these modules via UK/IE links.

Performance Standards and Service Levels

Per Work order, your company’s performance will be measured across the following SLS metrics, and your company will be expected to meet the SLS targets included on this page. Below presents the target and minimum service level per metric. If you repeatedly* fall below the Minimum Service Levels (presented below), it can result in a reduction of volume allocated to your company, or termination of your company’s Work order

* Definition of Repeatedly = falling below the minimum requirement in 2 consecutive instances (weekly scorecards) below minimum requirement
* Metrics and the associated targets are subject to change. We reserve the right to make amendments with notice in writing including via email, 8 weeks prior to change.

Metric Definitions
UK/ IE,   DE/ AT,   ES,   FR,   BE,   NL,   IT

Safety
Includes metrics such as Vehicle Audit (VSA) Compliance, Safe Driving Metric, Seatbelt off Rate (only for UK DSP 2.0s), Speeding event Rate, Daily Vehicle Inspection Check Compliance and E-Mentor Adoption Rate. (See Below for more details)
Vehicle Audit (VSA) Compliance
Vehicle Audit (VSA) Compliance is calculated as the DVIC Checks verified by Amazon over last two weeks. We calculate this metric as the count of vehicles that have passed Amazon’s VSA check against the total number of vehicles audited during WK-2 and WK-1. Vehicle Audit (VSA) Compliance calculation: Total VSA Passed Audits (WK-2 & WK-1) / Total VSA Audits (WK-2 & WK-1). A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >=100% in VSA.
Safe Driving Metric (FICO) 
This metric is calculated using the eDriving Mentor FICO score, which is a composite potential indicator of a driver’s safe driving behaviour. The metric is measured by analysing indicators of how your drivers operate their vehicles, such as Harsh Acceleration, Braking, Cornering, Cell phone Distraction and Speeding. The metric is a weighted average of all driver’s eDriving Mentor FICO scores at the end of the week on a 100 – 850 scale where a higher score is better. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >=800 in FICO.

Speeding Event Rate
The Speeding Event Rate metric is the average number of speeding instances incurred by a DA per route. A speeding instance is counted as exceeding the speed limit by 20% or more for at least 60 seconds. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a <= 5% speeding events per 100 trips.
DVIC Compliance
The Daily Vehicle Inspection Check (DVIC) allows you to stay up-to-date on the condition of the vehicles, thus ensuring vehicles are safe for its drivers and the community. Drivers are required to perform pre trip DVIC before they are able to pick up route, and a post trip after completion of route (DVIC compliance). The metric is calculated as The rate of vehicles inspected after the return to stations out of all the 'Inspected Vehicles' (before getting on road, hence pre-trip). Note: cargo bikes and walking routes are excluded from metric calculations. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >=100% in DVIC.
E-Mentor Adoption Rate 
The E-Mentor Adoption Rate allows you to understand what percent of your drivers are using Mentor App on a weekly basis. This metric is calculated by number of active drivers on the Mentor app divided by total active drivers for the particular week. If your drivers have low adoption rates, your other safety metrics might be impacted, resulting in overall lower score. We encourage DSPs to increase eMentor app adoption rate with the drivers to help support improved driver behaviour. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >= 90% in EMentor Adoption Rate.

















Compliance
We regularly audit for compliance to ensure DSP’s business operations adhere to Amazon supply chain standards and program policy.
Comprehensive Audit Score
The Comprehensive Audit is a measurement of DSP/Driver Eligibility, DSP Operations, Safety, Wages & Benefits, DSP Management, and Working Hours (all measurements outlined in the DSP Program Agreements and Policies). The results of the Comprehensive Audit provide a baseline for a DSP’s state of compliance. Compliance is critical to ensuring a good working environment for you and your drivers and meeting our compliance standards is required. You must earn an 'In Compliance' on your Comprehensive Audit to be eligible for scorecard evaluation and not be in Breach of Contract (BOC). A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a 100% in CAS.

Working Hour Compliance (WHC)
WHC metric is based on a DSP's continuous compliance with working hour requirements as established by Amazon Supply Chain Standards, Amazon Logistics business policy, and prevailing local law. This includes compliance with: Daily and weekly working hour thresholds; Maximum permissible consecutive workdays; and Minimum required rest between shifts. The metric is calculated as % of drivers complying with working hour limits. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a 100% in WHC.

Delivery Quality
Includes metrics: Delivery Completion Rate, Delivered not Received DPMO and SWA On-time Arrival (DSPs within the SWA program)
Delivery Completion Rate 
The share of packages dispatched to the drivers which are delivered to the customer (and not returned to the station). Thresholds are set at the station level to account for regional differences. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >= 99.0999999999995% in DCR.
Delivered Not Received DPMO 
The number of packages delivered but not received by customer, on per million opportunities / delivered (DPMO) basis. Thresholds are set at the station level to account for regional differences. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a <= 1060 in DNR DPMO.
Lost on Road (LoR) DPMO
The number of packages dispatched to the drivers but not delivered to the customer (and not returned to the station), on per million opportunities / dispatched (DPMO) basis. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a <=215 LoR DPMO.

Includes metrics on Photo on Delivery, Contact Compliance and SWA Scan Compliance (only applicable for DSPs within the SWA program)
Photo on Delivery
The number of usable (i.e. presentable to the customer) POD (Photo-on-delivery) photos taken, divided by total POD opportunities. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >=98.5% in Photo on Delivery.
Contact Compliance
The metric is calculated as the count of all calls and texts that were made by a driver through the Amazon Flex app vs the total packages delivered with a call or text, as well as packages not delivered due to reasons such as Unable to Access (UTA), Unable to Locate (UTL), No Safe Locations (NSL). A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a 98% in Contact Compliance.
 Customer Feedback  Includes Positive Delivery Experience (DEX) and Customer Escalations DPMO. If you don't yet have a DEX score, we will consider DEX score based on your Customer Escalations DPMO.
Customer Delivery Feedback
CDF metric is a measurement of the customer feedback received after packages are delivered by the Delivery Associates (DAs). The metric is a weighted ratio that accounts for positive, negative, and no feedback. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a >= 82.5% in CDF.
Customer Escalations DPMO
Customer Escalations DPMO: The frequency at which drivers incur customer escalations, on a per-million opportunities (DPMO) basis. Violations are triple-weighted, and Defects are single weighted. Only successfully resolved tickets with customer escalations are counted with a 4-week delay. For example, Week 45 Scorecard Escalation Defect DPMO is calculated by counting and weighting the feedback incurred by drivers in Week 41 and not overturned by appeals. A DSP who has Fantastic standing would receive a 0 in Customer Escalations DPMO.

Includes Capacity Reliability
Capacity Reliability
Capacity Reliability compares your completed routes per day (excluding any Amazon caused cancellations) from Work Summary Tool to your day-level Reliability Targets from Route Targets (Okami) with an exception; if your final day-before scheduled plan comes in lower due to Amazon caused cancellations, those cancelled routes will be subtracted from your Reliability Target.
